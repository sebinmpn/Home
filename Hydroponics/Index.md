# HYDROPONICS PROJECT

The project aim is to develope a prototype of a fully automated modular hydroponics system specially designed for urban areas.



## Control Variables


1. Nutreint Variation - Nutreint balance should be accurate.
2. Water cycle - Proper water cycle for nutreint delivery with precise timing and measurement (PH & EC).
3. Light & Temperature - should be optimal for photosynthesis.


## KEY FACTORS

#### PH Level -
-  PH is critical because it affects the supply of nutrients for plant growth.
- optimal PH range for hydroponic crops is usually between 5.5 and 6.5.
- "PH up" and "PH down" are the process used to maintain the PH level.
- PH up - Decreasing Alkaline level by adding substance which have acidic properties
    - eg; Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) and Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). 

- PH Down - Decreasing Acidic level by adding substance which have Alkaline properties
    - eg; Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) and Sulfuric acid (NaHCO₃).

### EC Level -
Electrical Conductivity (EC) measures the ability of a solution to conduct electricity, which correlates to the concentration of nutrients in the solution.

- #### Nutrients Classification
    - Macro nutrients - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium.
    - Secondary nutrients - Sulpher, Calcium, Magnessium.
    - Micro nutrients -  Manganese, Iron, Boron, Copper and Zinc.


- optimal range of EC varies in base of plant's growth stage.
    - Low - 0.5 - 1.0 mS/cm - Seeding satge
    - Medium  - 1.0 - 2.0 mS/cm - Vegetative Stage
    - High 2.0 - 3.0 mS/cm - Flowering/Fruiting Stage
    
-  Selection of nutrients varies from plant to plant and amount of concentration varies in different growth stage.
- If nutrient is High,
    - Increase the water to maintain concentration.
    - PH level also should be checked.
- If nutrient is Low,
    - Add dosing  to maintain concentration.

### Oxygen Level -
Plants require oxygen for aerobic respiration, a process that converts glucose produced during photosynthesis into adenosine triphosphate (ATP).The presence of dissolved oxygen improves the efficiency of ion transport processes across root membranes, facilitating nutrient absorption via active transport and diffusion.

-   The maximum solubility of oxygen in water decreases with increase in temperature.
-   Insufficient oxygen levels can lead to anaerobic conditions, which can leads to growth of fungs.
-   optimal range for dissolved oxygen in hydroponic systems is typically between 5 mg/L and 8 mg/L.

- To increase oxygen level,

    - The addition of food-grade hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) can elevate dissolved oxygen levels due to its decomposition into water and oxygen.
    - Areation methods like bubles or periodic water circularion.

### Light intensity -
- The plant growth is limited by the rate of photosynthesis. Light cycle is crucial for photosynthesis.
    - Blue light (400-500 nm) - vegetative growth. 
    - Red light (600-700 nm) - Flowering and fruit growth.
- The grow light consist of various LED Combinations (RGB).
- Light intensity is seted based on the grow satge requirment and plant type.
