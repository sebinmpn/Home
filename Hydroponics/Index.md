# HYDROPONICS PROJECT

The project aim is to develope a prototype of a fully automated modular hydroponics system specially designed for urban areas.



## Control Variables


1. Nutreint Variation - Nutreint balance should be accurate
2. Water cycle - Proper water cycle for nutreint delivery with precisetiming and measurement
3. Light & Temperature - should be optimal for photosynthesis and respiration efficiently.

## KEY FACTORS

##### PH Level -
-  pH is critical because it affects the supply of nutrients for plant growth.
- optimal pH range for hydroponic crops is usually between 5.5 and 6 (acidic).
