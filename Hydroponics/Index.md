# HYDROPONICS PROJECT

The project aim is to develope a prototype of a fully automated modular hydroponics system specially designed for urban areas.



## Control Variables


1. Nutreint Variation - Nutreint balance should be accurate.
2. Water cycle - Proper water cycle for nutreint delivery with precise timing and measurement (PH & EC).
3. Light & Temperature - should be optimal for photosynthesis.


### Nutrients Classification
- Macro nutrients - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium.
- Secondary nutrients - Sulpher, Calcium, Magnessium.
- Micro nutrients -  Manganese, Iron, Boron, Copper and Zinc.

## KEY FACTORS

#### PH Level -
-  PH is critical because it affects the supply of nutrients for plant growth.
- optimal PH range for hydroponic crops is usually between 5.5 and 6 .
- "PH up" and "PH down" are the process used to maintain the PH level.
- PH up - Decreasing Alkaline level by adding substance which have acidic properties
eg; Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) and Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). 

- PH Down - Decreasing Acidic level by adding substance which have Alkaline properties
(eg; Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) and Sulfuric acid (NaHCO₃). )
