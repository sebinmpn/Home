Macro and Micronutrients:  essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK), and micronutrients (iron, magnesium, etc.). 

pH Control: Since pH affects nutrient availability, of ideal pH ranges for different plants (typically 5.5â€“6.5) 

Water Chemistry:  using filters or reverse osmosis systems to purify water, as poor water quality can introduce harmful elements (chlorine, heavy metals) into the system.
