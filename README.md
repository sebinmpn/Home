Macro and Micronutrients:  essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK), and micronutrients (iron, magnesium, etc.). 

pH Control: Since pH affects nutrient availability, of ideal pH ranges for different plants (typically 5.5–6.5) 

Water Chemistry:  using filters or reverse osmosis systems to purify water, as poor water quality can introduce harmful elements (chlorine, heavy metals) into the system.

CO2: Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis. An enclosed hydroponic system may require CO2 supplementation for optimal growth.

Air Quality: Pollutants or toxins in the air can affect plant health. Proper ventilation should be incorporated into the system to maintain air quality.

Water Quality: The quality of water (free from harmful chemicals like chlorine or heavy metals) is critical. Pre-filtration systems can help ensure the water is suitable for plant growth.

ideal temperature and humidity ranges for your plants (usually between 18-25°C, with 40-60% humidity).
