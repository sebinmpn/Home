Macro and Micronutrients:  essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK), and micronutrients (iron, magnesium, etc.). 

Nutrient Composition:

Macronutrients: Essential nutrients like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) are the most important.
Nitrogen: Promotes leaf growth. Important for leafy vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and herbs.
Phosphorus: Key for root development and flowering, especially for fruit-bearing plants like tomatoes and peppers.
Potassium: Enhances the overall health of the plant, helping in disease resistance and fruit development.
Micronutrients: Include Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), and Molybdenum (Mo). These trace elements are crucial for plant enzyme functions.

- pH Control: Since pH affects nutrient availability, of ideal pH ranges for different plants (typically 5.5–6.5) 

- Water Chemistry:  using filters or reverse osmosis systems to purify water, as poor water quality can introduce harmful elements (chlorine, heavy metals) into the system.

- CO2: Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis. An enclosed hydroponic system may require CO2 supplementation for optimal growth.

- Air Quality: Pollutants or toxins in the air can affect plant health. Proper ventilation should be incorporated into the system to maintain air quality.

- Water Quality: The quality of water (free from harmful chemicals like chlorine or heavy metals) is critical. Pre-filtration systems can help ensure the water is suitable for plant growth.

- ideal temperature and humidity ranges for your plants (usually between 18-25°C, with 40-60% humidity).

Artificial Chemicals
Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Calcium Nitrate (Ca(NO₃)₂) are often used for nitrogen supplementation.
Monopotassium Phosphate (KH₂PO₄) is widely used for phosphorus and potassium.


Plants require about 14-18 hours of light a day, depending on species. Use full-spectrum LEDs (in the 400-700 nm range) to mimic sunlight. Blue light (450-495 nm) supports vegetative growth, while red light (620-750 nm) encourages flowering and fruiting.

Use reverse osmosis (RO) or distilled water to ensure that the base water is free from impurities, which could interfere with nutrient uptake. Tap water often contains chlorine, fluorine, or calcium that may skew nutrient levels.

Use low-impact pesticides like Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for caterpillar control.
Different plants have varying temperature preferences. For example, lettuce thrives at lower temperatures (18-22°C), while tomatoes need higher warmth (24-30°C). Maintaining humidity at 50-70% will help prevent stress in most plants.

artifical 
Imidacloprid: A systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of pests, including aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. It interferes with the nervous system of insects, leading to paralysis and death.
Spinosad: A naturally derived but chemically processed pesticide that targets caterpillars, thrips, and leafminers. It affects the insect’s nervous system, causing death after ingestion.
Azadirachtin: A more refined version of neem oil, this insect growth regulator disrupts the molting process in insects, affecting caterpillars, beetles, and leafminers.
Sulfur: Used as a fungicide and miticide, sulfur helps control fungal diseases like powdery mildew and also works against mites.

organics 
Neem Oil: Derived from the neem tree, it's an effective treatment against aphids, mites, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects. It works as both a repellent and disruptor of insect feeding and reproduction.
Insecticidal Soap: A soap-based solution that targets soft-bodied pests like aphids, thrips, and spider mites by disrupting their cell membranes, causing dehydration.
Diatomaceous Earth: A fine powder made from fossilized algae, which damages the exoskeletons of insects like ants, cockroaches, and fleas, causing them to dehydrate and die.
Pyrethrin: Extracted from chrysanthemum flowers, it is used to control pests like aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. It affects the nervous system of insects but breaks down quickly in sunlight, making it less harmful to the environment.
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt): A naturally occurring bacterium that targets caterpillars and larvae of moths and butterflies. It infects the insect's gut, leading to death after ingestion.
Beauveria bassiana: A fungal biopesticide that infects and kills various insects like aphids, thrips, and whiteflies through fungal spores that penetrate the insect’s body and spread throughout.

In Hydroponic systems, usually, the liquid or solid medium is not as capable at buffering
the nutrients in the system as soil would be and is therefore much more susceptible to the
rapid changes in the nutrient levels. It is therefore that careful monitoring of the nutrient
level is required in such a system while this can easily be automated. Two very different
aspects of nutrition of the plant i. e. the supply of nutrients from the nutrient delivery
system and the plant nutrient response are needed to be considered.

Tomato

It is a very popular greenhouse
soil-less vegetable crop, which can be
grown round the year inside greenhouse.
4he night temperature range 16-22°C is the
most critical factor for the tomato fruit
setting. 

The ideal temperature range is 16-
25°C for better fruit development. Slicing
and cluster types are two major tomato
varieties transplanted in the month of
August-September for Indian condition. 

28-30 days old seedlings are transplanted atthe spacing of 60x50cm, with plantingdensity of about 2000 plants for 1000 m² drip
fertigated greenhouse. Three seedlings canbe transplanted in one meter long soil-less grow bag filled with cocopeat, perlite, vermiculite, tuff or mixture of
above. Greenhouse grown tomatoes needs regular trellising, training and pruning of plants. One single main stem
is retained by removing all side shoots or suckers that develop between leaf petioles and the stems. Greenhouse
grown tomato requires pollination inside greenhouse, which is usually provided either by Bumble bees or by
vibrators. Drip irrigation requirement varies from 2-8 m³/day/1000m².

 The fertigation requirement varies from N
80-150 ppm, P50-60 ppm and K 100-180 ppm for the major nutrient applies for different growth stages of the crop.
Greenhouse tomato yield varied from 150-200 t and 200-300 t/ha, respectively for cherry tomato and slicing type
big tomato. 

It tolerates saline water up to 3 dS/m (mmhos/cm) and fertigation pH in the range of (5.5-5.8) is found
to be ideal. It is found to be highly sensitive to calcium deficiency resulting in Blossom End Rot (BER). Proper Zn
and Mn nutrition result in alleviation of stress under saline condition. Common nutrient deficiency under soilless
condition: K deficiency affecting fruit quality mainly colour and blotch ripening
